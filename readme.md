# Applicatives vs Monads

This is a small workshop demonstraiting the usage of monads and applicatives.

## Exercise #1
This is a magic hat exercise. The function of magic hat is to assign developers to projects, with respect to their personal preferences around programming languages. Developer can only be assigned to one project at a time:
```
magicHat :: [Language] -> [Developer] -> [Project] -> [Possibility] -> [Assignment]
```
 - open ex1.hs file and start hacking
